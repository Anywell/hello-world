Hi Humans!

I'am Anywell, I like JavaScript.(even though I am not very good at it, that is why I come here. I will learn more about about it from here.)

Two years passed. I still stand here and have any improve. I fell so sorry for me. That I said to me, I would learn JavaScirpt from here, but I did nothing. Now two years have gone, I do what I do not like. But I do not know what I should do or not. I fell confused.

Never give up!

如今看到这个，真是令人唏嘘，如果当时，我坚定当初的选择，或许现在又是一番别的模样吧。
